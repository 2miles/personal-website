# personal-website

Personal website that highlights me and my professional experience. This Is the final project for my **CS-410 Intro to Web Development** class at PSU.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to gain hands on experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As well as having a useful professional website to add to a resume.

## How to run

Clone the project and open `index.html` in a web browser.

- **Note**: as of right now to view the CSS and images on your localhost all the links of the form ` /personal-website/style.css` need to be changed to the form ` ../style.css`
